# Hasher

This program computes a hash (i.e., checksum) for a file and optionally compares it to a known hash value.  It supports several industry standard hash algorithms such as MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256.

This software is charityware.  If you like Hasher and use it, I ask that you donate something to the charity of your choice.  I'll never know if you follow this policy, but the good karma from following it will be well worth your investment.
  
The latest version should always be available at http://www.menees.com.  Hasher requires the .NET Framework to be installed.  If you don't already have that, you can download it from Microsoft.
