# Hasher

This program computes a [hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function)
(i.e., checksum) for a file and optionally compares it to a known hash value.
It supports several industry standard hash algorithms such as MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256.
Hasher is a WPF app that runs on Windows only, and there are builds for .NET Framework 4.5
and .NET Core 3.1.

This software is charityware.  If you like Hasher and use it, I ask that you donate something
to the charity of your choice.  I'll never know if you follow this policy, but the good karma
from following it will be well worth your investment.
