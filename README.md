# Hasher

This program computes a [hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function)
checksum for a file and optionally compares it to a known hash value.
It supports several industry standard hash algorithms such as MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256.

Hasher is a WPF app that runs on Windows only, and there are builds for .NET Framework 4.8
and .NET 6. There is no Hasher installer. All releases are "portable", so you can run
them after extracting them to a folder (assuming the required .NET runtime is installed).
There are optional install.bat and uinstall.bat scripts to add or remove Hasher
shortcuts in Windows File Explorer's "Send To" context menu.

This software is charityware.  If you like Hasher and use it, I ask that you donate something
to the charity of your choice.  I'll never know if you follow this policy, but the good karma
from following it will be well worth your investment.
